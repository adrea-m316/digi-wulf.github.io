                                Hello, my name's Adreanna Martinez! I'm a graduate student looking to apply the skills
                                and knowledge I have recently obtained into the field here in Texas.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before I got into programming, I really enjoyed designing and creating different
                                drawings and concepts on my own. Although, I wasn't sure how to apply my creative skills, so I applied for a degree in Game Development and Simulation. However, when I had to take a few intro classes for Web-Development, I began to realize how much I enjoyed it, I quickly changed my major while still completing the certificate for Game Development and Simulation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During my college career, I was able to expand my knowledge and creative thinking in ways that I wouldnâ€™t have been able to do on my own. I have also been given the chance to work alongside, lead teams, and build that courage and confidence that is essential when working on projects, but also clients.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Currently, I am helping run and maintain the site <a href="https://magnoliaparkdiadelosmuertos.com/" class="links">Magnolia Park Dia de los Muertos</a>, which is hosted on Squarespace. When I was asked to help with the site, I had no prior knowledge of how Squarespace worked quickly adapted once I read up on any information needed to make the that would occur.
                            </p>

                        <!-- <p>
                        I'm not going to try to get you to like me with some big backstory on how I got into Web Development. I had to take a few Web classes in college for the Game Development and Simulation degree I was doing at the time. After taking the second required web development class, I realized I really enjoyed making websites. After much diliberation on whether to continue my degree in Game Development and Simulation or go for Web development degree instead. As you can guess I whent for a Web Development degree, but also a certificate in Game Development sinc I had done much of the degree already. After that to build on my confidence and skills, I whent for a Web Design certificate as well.
