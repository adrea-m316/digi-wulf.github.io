                        Hello, my name's Adreanna Martinez! I'm a graduate student looking to apply the skills and knowledge I have recently obtained into the field here in Texas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before I got into programming, I really enjoyed designing and creating different drawings and concepts on my own. Although, I wasn't sure how to apply my creative skills, so I applied for a degree in Game Development and Simulation. However, when I had to take a few intro classes for Web-Development, I began to realize how much I enjoyed it, I quickly changed my major while still completing the certificate for Game Development and Simulation.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        During my college career, I was able to expand my knowledge and creative thinking in ways that I wouldnâ€™t have been able to do on my own. I have also been given the chance to work alongside, lead teams, and build that courage and confidence that is essential when working on projects, but also clients. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am helping run and maintain the site <a href="https://magnoliaparkdiadelosmuertos.com/" class="links">Magnolia Park Dia de los Muertos</a>, which is hosted on Squarespace. When I was asked to help with the site, I had no prior knowledge of how Squarespace worked quickly adapted once I read up on any information needed to make the necessary changes or to troubleshoot small issues that would occur.
                    </p>
