              <h3>Why have storage redundancy?</h3>
                <p>
                  With the events of the past few years it has become evident that vital
                  information can be destroyed in a split second. It has become obvious that
                  all orginizations, especially hospital, must keep a backup of their vital
                  databases at a secure off-site location.<br><br>Gorwood Systems, Inc. provides a
                  secure off-site location equipt to maintain your vital documents in any
                  format- paper, microfilm, and digital.

              <h3>Consider the following:</h3>
                <p>
                  Your facility has a power failure and all computer systems are down. How do you
                  find a medical record number in an emergency? New software or updates to your
                  exhisting database require the whole system to be off line for a period of
                  time. Murphy's law steps in. You need medical information in a hurry! How long
                  will it take to search out the medical record number?<br><br>Water or fire damage
                  to your computer systems? Without the proper identification, a patient's vital
                  medical information may not be available in an emergency situation. We all
                  know what a problem double numbers can be to eliminate.
