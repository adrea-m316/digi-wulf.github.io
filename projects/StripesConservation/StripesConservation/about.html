          <p>As the largest species of cat in the world, tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth,
            strong jaws and agile bodies. They range across Asia from Russia all the way to the Sumatra
            and Indochina. However there is still much to learn about these beautiful, critically
            endangered, solitary cats.</p>
          <p>After a century of decline, the overall wild tiger numbers are starting to increase. According
            to some of the best available information, tiger populations are now stable or increasing in
            India, Nepal, Bhutan, Russia and China.</p>

          <p>Historically, tigers existed throughout much of Eastern and Southern Asia, as well as in parts of Central and Western Asia and the Middle East, surrounding the Caspian Sea. Their range has diminished significantly as human populations have expanded. It is believed they currently occupy just 7 percent of their historic range.</p>
          <p>Presently, tigers are found in a variety of habitats across South and Southeast Asia, China and Eastern Russia. They thrive in temperate, tropical or evergreen forests, mangrove swamps and grasslands. Amur tigers are primarily found in Far-East Russia, although there are small populations across the border into China and potentially North Korea. Sumatran tigers are found only on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. A tiger's range within these regions is determined by the availability of prey.</p>
