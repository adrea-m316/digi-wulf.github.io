          UNSETTLING MOVIE</h1>
        <p class="blog-post_text">
          Aster’s vision for Hereditary was inspired by a few horror staples
          including Carrie (1976) and Rosemary’s Baby (1968). But there was
          another, more obscure source he drew from when crafting his movie. For
          those who are unfamiliar with Peter Greenaway's The Cook, the Thief,
          His Wife and Her Lover, the 1989 film starring Helen Mirren and
          Michael Gambon, it centers on a woman having an affair with a man at
          her abusive husband’s restaurant.

          haunting </h1>
        <p class="blog-post_text">
          The first film in the “Conjuring”-verse is mostly an actual, reported
          event, if you believe in that sort of thing. As demonstrated with
          photos during the end credits of the movie, the Perron family really
          did exist, and reported they were being attacked by some kind of
          entity. The Warrens did, in fact, investigate. Both Lorraine Warren
          and the Perron family signed off on the movie as well (Ed died in
          2006).

        <p class="blog-post_text">
          He might not have wanted to be in the makeup chair for hours, but Tim
          Curry dedicated himself to the role in other ways. Most people think
          Pennywise’s wild puffs of red hair were a wig. But it was actually Tim
          Curry’s real hair, which he grew out for the role and then had teased
          and frizzed up every single day.

          Ring</h1>
        <p class="blog-post_text">
          The Ring is about a single spooky, cursed movie and Sinister is about
          a box o’ spooky, cursed movies. The similarity there isn’t
          coincidental. After watching The Ring, co-writer C. Robert Cargill,
          had a dream about going into his attic and finding a bunch of films
          that had the same kind of grizzly murder footage on them as the home
          movies that show up in Sinister. In fact, that dream was turned into
          the movie’s opening shot.
